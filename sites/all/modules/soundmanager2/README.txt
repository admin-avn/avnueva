SoundManager2 module

= Description =

This modules provides Drupal with the soundmanager2 (http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/)
player and with two styles: page-player and ui360.

Basically there are three modules:

* Sound Manager 2 module: adds the required swf and js for embedding the player. Other modules should use this module
    to load the soundmanager2 player.
* A CCK formatter: for filefield and nodereference for audio.module nodes.
* An SM2 audio modules integration: provides a new player with both styles for audio.module nodes

The styles are "muxtape" (page-player)

and ui360.
