<p>Mark all files served from the CDN to expire in the far future (decades from now). This is the same as telling browsers to <em>always</em> use the cached files. This can significantly speed up page loads. Files are also automatically compressed (when the browser supports it), to speed up page loads even further.<br />
Finally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing">CORS</a> (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is also enabled automatically for all these files, to prevent issues with fonts and JavaScript files being served from domains other than the origin domain.</p>
<p>Of course, you still want visitors to immediately get new versions of files when they change. That is why unique filenames are generated automatically.</p>

<h2>CSS aggregation</h2>
<p>It is necessary to enable CSS aggregation, if you don't enable CSS aggregation, files referenced by the CSS (such as images and fonts) files that are served from the CDN will <em>not</em> load. To prevent access to unauthorized files, every "Far Future URL" is <em>signed</em> with a security token.</p>
<p><em>Without</em> CSS aggregation, the URLs in the CSS files continue to be relative, and consquently, these files will be loaded using the same security token. But since the token is based on the filename, this will result in a HTTP 403 response.</p>
<p><em>With</em> CSS aggregation, the URLs in the CSS files will be rewritten. <em>However</em>, Drupal core's CSS aggregation is not very smart either, and it will in fact cause more or less the same problem. That's why the CDN module comes with an override of Drupal core's CSS aggregation, which correctly alters <em>every</em> file URL. As a result, this also enables us to e.g. serve the CSS file from one CDN, the images referenced by it from another and the fonts referenced by it from yet another.</p>

<h2>Detailed information for the experts</h2>
<p>The following HTTP headers are set: <tt>Expires</tt>, <tt>Cache-Control</tt>, <tt>Last-Modified</tt>, <tt>Vary</tt> and <tt>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</tt> for files with one of the following extensions: <tt>css</tt>, <tt>js</tt>, <tt>svg</tt>, <tt>ico</tt>, <tt>gif</tt>, <tt>jpg</tt>, <tt>jpeg</tt>, <tt>png</tt>, <tt>otf</tt>, <tt>ttf</tt>, <tt>eot</tt>, <tt>woff</tt>, <tt>flv</tt>, <tt>swf</tt> and of these extensions, some will also be automatically compressed: <tt>css</tt>, <tt>js</tt>, <tt>ico</tt>, <tt>svg</tt>, <tt>eot</tt>, <tt>otf</tt>, <tt>ttf</tt>.</p>
