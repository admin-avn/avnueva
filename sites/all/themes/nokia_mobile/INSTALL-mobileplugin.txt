PRE-REQUISITES
--------------
The theme might work with Drupal 5 or limited changes might be required, but
it was tested only on Drupal 6.*. It is therefore recommended to use the most
recent Drupal 6 version available.
The use of the Mobile Plugin is recommended, but NOT a requirement. See below
for more details.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Get your Drupal 6 installed
2. Download and install the Mobile Plugin http://drupal.org/project/mobileplugin
		WARNING: hosted sites might have trouble with the generation of WURFL cache
3. Update WURFL before you complete the mobile plugin install OR force a WURFL
	cache refresh
4. Install nokia_mobile theme in sites/all/themes (See below for more details)
5. Go to Site building > Themes and enable (NOT as default) the nokia_mobile
	theme
6. Go to Site Building > Mobile Plugin > Device groups
7. Click on "Edit group" for the group "mobile"
	Theme: nokia_mobile
	-SAVE-
8. Click on "add new group"
	Name: nokia low-end
	Theme: nokia_mobile
	-SAVE-
9. Click on "add new group"
	Name: nokia high-end
	Theme: nokia_mobile
	-SAVE-
10. Click on "add new group"
	Name: nokia high-end with touch
	Theme: nokia_mobile
	-SAVE-
11. Click on "Filter group css and js" for the "nokia low-end" group
12. Add the following line in the JS textarea:
	sites/all/themes/nokia_mobile/scripts/low/
	-SAVE-
13. Do the same for the "nokia high-end" and "nokia high-end with touch" groups,
	but add the line:
	sites/all/themes/nokia_mobile/scripts/high/
	-SAVE-
14. Go to "Detection rules"
15. Edit the last detection rule, the one that sets the device to the group
	"mobile". Change the group to "nokia low-end".
16. Go to Site building > Themes > Configure and choose nokia_mobile. At the
	bottom of the page make sure you have checked "Detect devices based on
	Nokia rules (default)." and pick a color for the buttons, "Blue" if you go
	with the standard Drupal color, for example. Click "Save configuration".

Everything should be setup now. Use your mobile device to access your site and
you should magically get a different presentation. The theme will be different
based on the device you are using, there is a low-end presentation that should
work with all browsers and devices and a high-end design that will work with
almost all Symbian devices and with devices such as the iPhone, the Palm Pre
and Android.
