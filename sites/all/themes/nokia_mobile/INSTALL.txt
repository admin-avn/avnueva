PRE-REQUISITES
--------------
The theme might work with Drupal 5 or limited changes might be required, but
it was tested only on Drupal 6.*. It is therefore recommended to use the most
recent Drupal 6 version available.
The use of the Mobile Plugin is recommended, but NOT a requirement. See below
for more details.


INSTALLATION
------------

Install the theme like any other theme in Drupal, unzip in sites/all/themes and
then activate it from Administer > Site Building > Themes.
Configure as the default theme if you are serving mobile only, or use one of the
many plugins to switch automatically. See below or http://drupal.org/node/698010
for more details.
